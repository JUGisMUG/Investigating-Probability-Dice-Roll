# Investigating-Probability-Dice-Roll
This a program to investigate probability by the rolling of a dice twice for 100 times and seeing how much times TT, HH and HT/TH is obtained. I made this code like an year ago but didn't even upload it, so I thought I would do now..

What it does:

- Tosses a coin twice (either head or tails is obtained)
- Repeats for 100 times. (Tosses a coin twice for 100 times basically)
- Checks each time that if the 1st toss is different from the 2nd toss (like if the first toss is heads and the other is tails or vice-versa)
- after doing this for 100 times, it gives a count of how many times the coin got one head and one tail and how many times it got TT or HH.
